Model Diagnostics:

Residuals: 
    Notes say "plot residuals against a predictor, or fitted values, to examine whether there is any patern."
    Which do we use?
    Do we have to visually inspect all pairs of predictors vs residuals?
QQ Plot
Transformations
Do we have to use both leverage and cooks distance?
For cooks' distance it says D>1 suggests an influential point. So what if D<1?
Partial Residual Plots: Do we have to visually inspect all pairs?


Questions we can answer:

What is the effect of design inputs on...
    design outputs?
    slg responses or ratings?
    location of max. slg responses or ratings?
    fe responses or ratings?
    location of max. fe responses or ratings?
    
    

2-span continuous steel 
strength 1 flexure

conservative design can be captured by the ratio of fe/slg

Significance Tests:
fe vs slg ratings (is there a statistically significant difference between fe and slg?)
interior vs exterior ratio
